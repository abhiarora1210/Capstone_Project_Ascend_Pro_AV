The notebook named EDA - Copy requires the utilization data and termination data files and creates a "Final_for model.csv"
for the RF (Random Forest) and DT (Decision Tree) notebooks to use.

The comparison curves come from the DT notebook wherein the best model from RF is imported. It is saved in the "Saved Models"
folder.
